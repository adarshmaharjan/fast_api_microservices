# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing and improving the FastAPI payment microservice. The current implementation has several critical issues including improper error handling, incorrect HTTP requests, missing imports, and potential race conditions that lead to CancelledError exceptions.

## Glossary

- **Payment_Service**: The FastAPI-based microservice responsible for processing payment orders
- **Order_Model**: The Redis-based data model representing a payment order
- **Product_Service**: External service providing product information via HTTP API
- **Redis_Database**: Redis instance used for order storage and event streaming
- **Background_Task**: Asynchronous task that processes order completion
- **Order_Stream**: Redis stream for publishing order completion events

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a payment service, I want to handle HTTP requests properly, so that I can communicate with external services without errors

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making HTTP requests to external services, THE Payment_Service SHALL use the requests library correctly with proper URL formatting
2. THE Payment_Service SHALL handle HTTP request failures gracefully with appropriate error responses
3. THE Payment_Service SHALL validate external service responses before processing
4. IF an external service is unavailable, THEN THE Payment_Service SHALL return a meaningful error message to the client
5. THE Payment_Service SHALL include proper timeout configurations for external HTTP requests

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a payment service, I want to process order creation requests correctly, so that orders are created with valid data

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving an order creation request, THE Payment_Service SHALL parse the JSON request body correctly
2. THE Payment_Service SHALL validate that required fields (id, quantity) are present in the request
3. THE Payment_Service SHALL fetch product information from the Product_Service using the correct product ID
4. THE Payment_Service SHALL calculate order totals based on retrieved product price and predefined fee structure
5. THE Payment_Service SHALL save the order to the Redis_Database with a unique identifier

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a payment service, I want to handle background task processing reliably, so that order completion is processed without causing service interruptions

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an order is created, THE Payment_Service SHALL schedule a background task for order completion
2. THE Background_Task SHALL update the order status to "completed" after the specified delay
3. THE Background_Task SHALL publish order completion events to the Order_Stream
4. THE Payment_Service SHALL handle task cancellation gracefully without propagating CancelledError exceptions
5. IF a background task fails, THEN THE Payment_Service SHALL log the error and maintain service stability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a payment service, I want to configure CORS properly, so that frontend applications can access the service

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Payment_Service SHALL configure CORS middleware with correct origin URLs
2. THE Payment_Service SHALL allow necessary HTTP methods for payment operations
3. THE Payment_Service SHALL handle preflight requests correctly
4. THE Payment_Service SHALL validate origin URLs to prevent unauthorized access

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a payment service, I want to handle Redis connections securely, so that sensitive connection details are protected

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Payment_Service SHALL load Redis connection parameters from environment variables
2. THE Payment_Service SHALL handle Redis connection failures gracefully
3. THE Payment_Service SHALL validate Redis connection on startup
4. THE Payment_Service SHALL use secure connection practices for production environments
5. THE Payment_Service SHALL implement connection retry logic for transient failures
